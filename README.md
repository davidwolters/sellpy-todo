# Sellpy x David - Todo Application

This is my solution for the todo application.

The project consists of a TypeScript Express server, and a JS frontend.

## Solution

A rather simple solution, I implemented server side persistence, autosave, completion marking and marking entire lists as complete.

## Installation

Tested on Node version v15.0.0. Should work with most major versions after this.

### Requirements

1. Node version at least 15
2. Typescript

### Backend

1. `cd backend && touch .env` to create the `.env` file. Use `.env.example` as a basis.
2. `npm install`

### Frontend

1. `cd app && touch . env` to create the `.env` file. Use `.env.example` as a basis.
2. `npm install`

## Running the project

```bash
cd backend && npm start
cd frontend && npm start
```
